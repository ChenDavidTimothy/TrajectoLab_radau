# Solution Access Tutorial

This directory contains tutorial materials for working with MAPTOR solution data.

## Files

- `reference_implementation.py` - Complete reference showing all solution access patterns
- Documentation at `docs/source/tutorials/solution_access.rst`

## Purpose

Demonstrates comprehensive solution data extraction using MAPTOR's `Solution` class,
including mission-wide trajectories, phase-specific data, adaptive algorithm analysis,
and advanced visualization preparation.

## Usage

```bash
cd tutorials/solution_access
python reference_implementation.py
```

The reference implementation uses a two-phase Schwartz optimal control problem to
showcase every available method for accessing multiphase optimization results.
